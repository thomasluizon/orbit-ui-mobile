/**
 * Gate repository-root entries by location, not by guessed filename patterns.
 *
 * The allowlist is deliberately a closed set: every unlisted root file AND every unlisted root
 * directory fails regardless of its name, extension, or leading dot. Adding a legitimate root entry
 * therefore requires a visible data change instead of another pattern that only recognizes shapes
 * already seen.
 *
 * Both halves are closed on purpose. Gating files alone left the same scratch one level down, so
 * `.artifacts/transcript.mjs` walked past a gate written to stop exactly that.
 *
 * Two classes of declared entry are not committed content and are declared anyway, because they
 * legitimately appear on a real checkout and a gate that fires on them would block every commit:
 *   - generated directories (`node_modules`, `.turbo`), observed after an install and a test run
 *   - local environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`), which `.gitignore` already blesses at the root
 * Any further local variant (`.env.production.local`) is a deliberate one-line addition here. That
 * friction is the feature: a new root entry is a real architectural addition and should not be silent.
