# Debugging & investigation

**At a glance:** 8 standing rules for chasing a bug, triaging an issue, `/investigate`, and resolving merge conflicts. Judgement-bound; none is gate-checkable. See `README.md` for the tier's contract.

The through-line: **you earn the right to hypothesise by first building something that can prove you wrong.**

## Before you theorise

### 1. No red-capable command, no hypothesising
Build one command **you have already run** that is:

- **red-capable** — it drives the real code path and asserts the exact symptom,
- **deterministic** — same result every run,
- **fast** — you will run it dozens of times,
- **agent-runnable** — no manual clicking.

Until that command exists and is red, you have no bug; you have a story about a bug. Global rule 5 asks for "a check you can run" but never sets the bar or forbids theorising before it exists. This does both. `/investigate` starts from a Sentry issue and has no equivalent gate for a local bug.

### 2. Minimise the repro before hypothesising
Once the loop is red, **cut before you think**: inputs, callers, config, steps — one at a time, re-running after each cut, until every remaining element is load-bearing.

This shrinks the hypothesis space before you spend hypotheses on it, and it hands you the regression test for free.

## While you theorise

### 3. Three to five ranked hypotheses, each with a falsifiable prediction
Generate **3-5 ranked hypotheses before testing any of them.** Each must state what would make it false: *"if X is the cause, changing Y makes the bug disappear."*

**A hypothesis with no stated prediction is a vibe — sharpen it or discard it.** Then change **one variable per probe**.

This directly counters single-hypothesis anchoring, the dominant failure mode of a confident debugger. It complements the refutation-over-voting ADR without duplicating it: that ADR governs multi-agent review, this governs debugging.

### 4. Tag every temporary debug log with a unique prefix
Use something greppable and unmistakable — `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Removing all instrumentation is then a single grep, and **confirm the grep is empty before declaring the fix done**.

The no-`console.log` gate catches what survives to a commit. This makes cleanup **structural during the session** instead of relying on the gate to catch a leak.

## After you are right

### 5. State the winning hypothesis in the commit or PR
Record **which hypothesis turned out correct**, so the next debugger inherits the reasoning and not just the diff.

Cheap, durable, and nothing in the git conventions asks for the why behind a fix.

## Triage

### 6. Search by domain concept, not by the issue's wording
Before acting on an issue, search the codebase for an existing implementation **by what it does**, not by the words the reporter used — and **report where you looked**. An already-implemented request is closed pointing at where it lives, not built a second time.

Not covered by `/prime`, `/plan`, or the tooling defaults, which say to read the named issue but never to check whether it is already done. This is the exact failure mode of a long backlog carried across many sessions.

### 7. Verify the claim before planning against it
Reproduce the bug from the reporter's steps, or run the tests for a PR that claims a fix. Report the outcome as one of three:

- **confirmed** — with the code path,
- **failed to reproduce**,
- **insufficient detail**.

**Insufficient detail is itself the finding**, not a reason to guess and proceed. This sharpens global rule 1 into a concrete pre-planning step; `/investigate` is prod-incident-only and never-assume never names reproduction as a gate before a plan is written.

## Merge conflicts

### 8. Resolve from primary sources; never invent behaviour in a hunk
Read **each side's originating commit, PR, and issue** to recover intent before choosing. Then:

- where the two intents **compose**, preserve both;
- where they are **incompatible**, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off.

**Never invent new behaviour in a conflict hunk, and never `--abort`.**

A conflict hunk is precisely where invented behaviour slips in unreviewed — it arrives already looking like someone else's code. This matches the read-before-you-claim and root-cause postures, and nothing in the git workflow covered conflict resolution.
