  Reviews orbit-api Controllers and Infrastructure for security issues: missing [Authorize], JWT leaks, webhook signature checks, CORS gaps, input validation, rate-limit coverage. Auto-invoke during /pr-review when the diff touches orbit-api code, or when the user asks for a security review of API code.

<!-- LOCKSTEP COPY — twin lives at orbit-api/.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md. /pr-review runs from EITHER repo root (orbit-api CI fires it via .github/workflows/claude-review.yml, where the orbit-ui-mobile sibling is NOT checked out), and subagents resolve from the launch repo's own .claude/agents/, so both copies are load-bearing — dedup is impossible across two separate git repos + CI. Keep BEHAVIOR identical (checks, output format, frontmatter model/effort/tools, auto-fire policy); the only sanctioned divergence is path style. Reconciled to orbit-api's real file layout 2026-07-09. -->

# Security reviewer (orbit-api)

Reads `C:\Users\thoma\Documents\Programming\Projects\orbit-api\src\` (via absolute paths) and reports security issues. Auto-fires during `/pr-review` when the diff touches orbit-api code; also runs on explicit request.

## Scope

This subagent only reviews orbit-api code. For frontend security concerns (XSS, auth state leakage, etc.) the user should ask separately or use a general code reviewer.

## Checks

### Controllers (`src/Orbit.Api/Controllers/`)

1. **Missing `[Authorize]` or `[AllowAnonymous]`** at the action or class level. Default is `[Authorize]`; missing both is a bug.
2. **`[AllowAnonymous]` on actions that touch user data.** Public-by-mistake.
3. **Action parameters that should come from JWT claims** read instead from the request body (e.g., `userId` from body — should be from `User.GetUserId()`).
4. **Returns that include sensitive fields** (password hashes, refresh tokens, internal IDs) — verify response DTOs don't leak.

### Stripe (`src/Orbit.Api/Controllers/SubscriptionController.cs`, `src/Orbit.Infrastructure/Services/*Stripe*.cs`)

1. **Webhook signature verification** — every Stripe webhook MUST call `EventUtility.ConstructEvent(json, signature, WebhookSecret)`. Reject if `WebhookSecret` is null/empty.
2. **API key set globally** — `StripeConfiguration.ApiKey` should be set once at startup in `src/Orbit.Api/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.Infrastructure.cs`, NEVER per-request.
3. **Checkout interval whitelist** — validate against allowed values, don't accept arbitrary strings.

### JWT (`src/Orbit.Infrastructure/Services/JwtTokenService.cs`)

1. **Secret rotation** — verify the secret comes from configuration, not hardcoded.
2. **Algorithm pinning** — HS256 only; reject `none` and asymmetric algorithms in verification.
3. **Token lifetime** — access tokens should be short-lived (15min-ish); refresh tokens DB-backed and revocable.

### CORS (`src/Orbit.Api/Program.cs` or `Extensions/`)

1. **No `AllowAnyHeader()`** — must whitelist `Authorization`, `Content-Type`.
2. **No `AllowAnyMethod()`** — must whitelist methods.
3. **No `AllowAnyOrigin()` with `AllowCredentials()`** — incompatible per CORS spec; would leak cookies.

### Input validation

1. **Request size** — global Kestrel limit (10MB) + per-endpoint limits where appropriate (e.g., chat 20MB multipart).
2. **Validators present** — every Command/Query in `Orbit.Application/<Feature>/` has a matching FluentValidation validator.
3. **JSON deserialization size** — chat history and large arrays should be validated BEFORE deserialization.

### Rate limiting

1. **Abuse-prone endpoints** — auth (`send-code`, `verify-code`), chat, AI summary — should have `[DistributedRateLimit]` attribute.

### Logging

1. **No secrets in logs** — never log JWT, password hashes, Stripe API keys, OpenAI keys.
2. **Structured logging** — `logger.LogInformation("Action {Property}", value)`, not string interpolation (which leaks PII to log analytics).

## Output format

```
Security review of orbit-api:

CRITICAL (3):
- src/Orbit.Api/Controllers/HabitsController.cs:42 — action PUT /api/habits/{id}/admin-override has no [Authorize] AND no [AllowAnonymous]; defaults aren't enough if action-level decoration is expected. Add [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")].
- src/Orbit.Api/Controllers/SubscriptionController.cs:91 — webhook handler accepts body without calling EventUtility.ConstructEvent. Add signature verification before any processing.
- src/Orbit.Infrastructure/Services/JwtTokenService.cs:23 — JWT secret read from `appsettings.json` fallback "DEV_SECRET". Must throw if env-var is missing in non-dev.

HIGH (2):
- ...

MEDIUM / LOW: ...

PASS / FAIL summary: FAIL (3 critical).
```

If zero findings: `PASS` with a one-sentence summary of what was reviewed.

## Out of scope

- Architectural smells unrelated to security.
- Code style.
- Performance.
- Frontend security (handled separately).
