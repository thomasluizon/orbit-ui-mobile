description: Orchestrate one or more issues from number to PR by chaining the existing pipeline — /prime (context load only) → grill-me → /plan → [HARD GATE: user approves the plan] → /implement — with a blocking confirmation gate at every stage boundary. Nothing auto-advances; nothing implements without explicit approval. One issue runs in the main session; 2+ issues fan the same gated loop out across paired worktrees, like /prime, /plan, and /implement. Use when the user wants to take issues end-to-end with checkpoints they control.

# Execute: issue → prime → grill → plan → implement (gated)

A thin conductor over the PIV control loop. It invokes the commands and skill that
already exist and inserts a hard, blocking gate at every stage boundary. It writes
no new logic and re-implements nothing — `/prime`, `grill-me`, `/plan`, and
`/implement` own their own behavior. Reference them by name; never restate how they
work.

**The control loop:**

```
/prime <issue>  →  [GATE 1]  →  grill-me  →  [GATE 2]  →  /plan <issue>  →  [GATE 3]  →  /implement <plan-path>
 (load only)                  (questions)                 (writes plan)    (approve)     (owns its own push gate)
```

## Inputs & mode

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` — one or more issue numbers (`123` or `#123`).

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and count numeric tokens (split on whitespace OR commas, mirroring
`/prime`'s mode detection):

| Numeric tokens | Action |
|---|---|
| 0 | Ask the user for an issue number. Do nothing else until you have one. |
| 1 | Proceed with the single-issue control loop below. |
| ≥ 2 | Jump to **## Multi-issue mode**. Do NOT run the single-issue stages below — the multi flow fans the same gated loop out across paired worktrees. |

`/execute` targets issues in `thomasluizon/orbit-ui-mobile`.

## Stage 1 — PRIME (context load only)

Run `/prime <issue>` in single-issue mode. Wait for its context summary and stop
there. `/prime` is load-only: it loads both repos, the issue, conventions, and recent
state, and ends at its own "Suggested next step: `/plan …`". It never plans, never
edits files, never implements. Do NOT carry past `/prime`'s output into any work —
the only path forward is GATE 1. This is the standing rule from
`feedback_prime_loads_context_only.md`: priming loads context, full stop.

Then present **GATE 1**.

## Stage 2 — GRILL (clarifying questions)

Once GATE 1 returns `proceed`, invoke the `grill-me` skill against the primed issue
context. Use it to resolve the open questions and risks `/prime` surfaced and any
ambiguity in the acceptance criteria. `grill-me` owns the mechanics (one question at a
time; `Question / Recommended answer / Why it matters`; no code during grilling). Do
not re-describe grilling here and do not write code while grilling.

The user exits the grill loop explicitly. That exit is **GATE 2**.

## Stage 3 — PLAN

Once GATE 2 returns `proceed`, run `/plan <issue>` in single-plan mode, folding in the
decisions resolved during grilling. The single-issue plan lands at
`.claude/plans/issue-<N>.plan.md`. Capture that exact path — Stage 4 needs it.

`/plan` ends at its own passive "Next Step: Review the plan, then `/implement …`".
`/execute` replaces that suggestion with the active, blocking **GATE 3**.

## Stage 4 — IMPLEMENT (only after the hard plan gate)

Reachable ONLY through an explicit `approve` at GATE 3. Run
`/implement .claude/plans/issue-<N>.plan.md` (path-based mode) with the path captured
in Stage 3.

`/implement` owns its OWN downstream confirmation: it asks the user to confirm before
pushing and opening the PR (its Phase 7). `/execute` does NOT re-add or fight that
gate — `/execute` owns the gates up to and including the pre-implement approval, then
delegates the push/PR checkpoint to `/implement`.

## Gates (the core of this skill)

Every stage boundary is a HARD, blocking confirmation. Default-deny: on no response or
an ambiguous response, do nothing — restate the gate and wait. Never auto-advance.

### GATE 1 — after PRIME, before GRILL

Show the `/prime` summary: issue title / labels / parity flag, acceptance criteria,
open questions / risks, and current branches.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `proceed` | Start grilling (Stage 2). |
| `edit <note>` / `clarify <note>` | Fold the note into grilling, then start Stage 2. |
| `abort` | Stop. Report that nothing past priming ran. |

### GATE 2 — after GRILL, before PLAN

Show the resolved decisions and answers from grilling.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `proceed` | Run `/plan` (Stage 3). |
| `more` | Keep grilling (back to Stage 2). |
| `abort` | Stop. |

### GATE 3 — after PLAN, before IMPLEMENT (the critical gate)

Show the plan path plus the plan's **Summary**, **Files to Change**, and **Tasks**.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `approve` | Run `/implement <plan-path>` (Stage 4). |
| `revise <feedback>` | Re-run `/plan` with the feedback. Loop back to GATE 3. Do NOT implement. |
| `abort` | Stop. |

**NOTHING is implemented without an explicit `approve` here.** No response, a question,
or anything other than `approve` keeps the loop at the plan — it never falls through to
`/implement`.

### Final checkpoint (not owned here)

The push/PR confirmation inside `/implement` (its Phase 7) remains the final gate and
is intentionally NOT duplicated by `/execute`.

## Multi-issue mode

User passed 2+ issue numbers. `/execute` runs the SAME gated loop, fanned out: PRIME,
PLAN, and IMPLEMENT delegate to `/prime`, `/plan`, and `/implement` **in their own
multi-issue modes** (parallel worktree subagents, `issue-<N>` branches, concurrency cap
— all owned there, never restated here). GRILL stays in the main session: it is an
interactive conversation with you, so it runs once per issue in turn, never as a
subagent. The three gates become BATCH gates over all issues, with per-issue responses
allowed.

```
/prime <N…>  →  [GATE A]  →  grill each in turn  →  [GATE B]  →  /plan <N…>  →  [GATE C]  →  /implement <N…>
(parallel worktrees)         (main session)                     (parallel worktrees)         (parallel worktrees)
```

### Stage 1 (multi) — PRIME all

Run `/prime <N1> <N2> …`. It validates each issue, creates the paired worktrees, and
primes each in a parallel subagent, returning the aggregated table. Lean on each
issue's reported **open questions / risks** — they are the grill agenda for Stage 2;
request them if a subagent's summary omits them. Then present **GATE A**.

### Stage 2 (multi) — GRILL each, in turn

Once GATE A returns `proceed`, grill the issues ONE AT A TIME in the main session:
announce which issue is up, invoke `grill-me` against that issue's primed summary + open
questions, resolve it, then move to the next. Keep each issue's resolved decisions
SEPARATE — Stage 3 folds each issue's decisions into that issue's own plan. After the
last issue is grilled, present **GATE B**.

### Stage 3 (multi) — PLAN all

Once GATE B returns `proceed`, run `/plan <N1> <N2> …`. It writes one plan per issue in
parallel worktree subagents at `<worktree>/.claude/plans/issue-<N>.plan.md`. Pass each
subagent its issue's resolved grill decisions so the plan reflects them. Capture every
plan path, then present **GATE C**.

### Stage 4 (multi) — IMPLEMENT all

Reachable ONLY through an explicit `approve` at GATE C. Run `/implement <N1> <N2> …` for
the approved issues. Each implements in its worktree via a parallel subagent and opens
its own PR(s); a failing issue does NOT halt its siblings. `/implement` still owns its
per-worktree push/PR confirmation — `/execute` does not duplicate it.

### Batch gates

Same default-deny discipline as the single-issue gates: no or ambiguous response →
restate and wait, never auto-advance. Each gate takes a blanket verb OR per-issue
scoping (`<N…>` = one or more issue numbers).

**GATE A — after PRIME all, before GRILL.** Show the aggregated prime table (issue /
title / repos / parity / worktree) plus each issue's open questions.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `proceed` | Grill every issue in turn (Stage 2). |
| `drop <N…>` | Drop those issues; proceed with the rest. |
| `abort` | Stop. Report the worktrees that were created. |

**GATE B — after GRILL all, before PLAN.** Show the resolved decisions per issue.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `proceed` | Run `/plan <N…>` (Stage 3). |
| `more <N>` | Re-grill that issue, then return to GATE B. |
| `abort` | Stop. |

**GATE C — after PLAN all, before IMPLEMENT (the critical gate).** Show each plan's path
plus its **Summary**, **Files to Change**, and **Tasks**.

| Response | Effect |
|---|---|
| `approve` | Implement ALL issues (Stage 4). |
| `approve <N…>` | Implement only those issues; hold the rest at the plan. |
| `revise <N> <feedback>` | Re-plan that issue with the feedback; loop back to GATE C. Do NOT implement it. |
| `abort` | Stop. |

**NOTHING implements without an explicit `approve` (blanket or per-issue) at GATE C.**
Anything else keeps every issue parked at the plan.

## Output / suggested next step

- **On normal completion:** defer to `/implement`'s own final output — single-issue:
  its Phase 9 branches + PR URLs; multi-issue: its aggregated per-issue table (PR URLs /
  validation / deviations, with failed issues flagged by worktree path). Do not
  re-summarize the implementation.
- **On abort at any gate:** state which stage it stopped at and how to resume — re-run
  `/execute <issue…>`, or jump straight to the next command in the loop (`/prime`,
  `grill-me`, `/plan`, or `/implement <issue…>` / `/implement .claude/plans/issue-<N>.plan.md`)
  to continue from that point.
