name: thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review
description: An extremely strict, BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING whole-repo structural refactor pass across one or both Orbit repos — split giant files, flatten spaghetti conditionals, deepen thin abstractions, dedup cross-app logic into packages/shared, move logic to its canonical layer — under hard build/test/EF-model gates, delivered as one PR per repo with an Applied table + a complete Deferred ledger. Use ONLY when the user explicitly asks for a thermo-nuclear / nuclear / deep structural-quality pass. This rewrites code; it is not the read-only /audit-code-quality.

# Thermo-Nuclear Code-Quality Review

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

Adapted at authoring time from cursor's `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`
(https://github.com/cursor/plugins — the strict maintainability rubric in **The standard**
below) and wrapped in the phased, coverage-contracted, hard-gated harness Orbit actually
ran it under. That URL is the single WHY-with-URL the comment policy allows.

**The one non-negotiable: every change is behavior-preserving.** Structure only — never
behavior, never UI, never an API/DTO contract, never the EF model/schema. If a refactor
*could* change what the program does, it is out of scope for this skill. The gate in
Phase 2 is not "tests pass," it is "behavior is provably identical."

**Golden rule**: deepen the codebase — more behavior behind a smaller, clearer interface —
without moving a single observable byte. A change that merely *relocates* size (a 1k file
becomes ten 100-line files that still do the same tangled thing) is reported honestly as
relocation, not celebrated as simplification.

---

## The standard — what "thermo-nuclear" flags

Strict, demanding, but never a nit machine. Lead with high-conviction structural wins;
quote the exact pattern when you flag it. Ranked by leverage — fix in this order:

1. **Structural regressions / missed dramatic simplifications** — the "code-judo move":
   a reframing of the state model or data shape that deletes whole branches. The highest
   prize; hunt it first.
2. **Spaghetti branching** — special-case `if/else` ladders and flag soup that grow every
   time a case is added. Flatten with early returns, a lookup table, or polymorphism.
3. **Boundary / abstraction clarity** — thin wrappers that earn nothing (the deletion
   test: if removing the module makes complexity vanish, it was a pass-through), and
   "magical" abstractions that hide control flow. Deepen the keepers; delete the
   indirection.
4. **Giant files** — anything past ~1k lines, or a file doing many jobs. Split by
   responsibility into sibling files. (C# giants: `partial class` — same compiled type,
   zero behavior risk. TS giants: extract inline subcomponents/helpers to siblings, render
   tree and hook order unchanged.)
5. **Cast / optionality churn** — `as`/`null!` (C#) or `as any`/`as unknown as X` (TS) and
   needless `?`-juggling that a better type or a single parse at the boundary removes.
6. **Modularity & cross-app duplication** — the same logic in `apps/web` and `apps/mobile`
   belongs in `packages/shared`; the same logic across handlers belongs in one helper.
   Dedup at the right level (root CLAUDE.md rule 10).
7. **Logic in the wrong layer** — business logic leaking into a controller/component/DTO
   instead of living in its canonical layer (domain entity, CQRS handler, shared util).

**Remedies preferred:** delete indirection · reframe the state model so branches collapse
· extract a well-named pure helper · split a file by responsibility · lift duplication to
`packages/shared` · move logic to its canonical layer · replace a cast tower with one
boundary parse. **Never** introduce a new DI service, reflection, a new MediatR command, a
new endpoint, or a behavior flag — those are behavior changes, not refactors.

---

## Phase 0 — Baseline + binding coverage contract

Resolve scope from `$ARGUMENTS` (blank → **both repos**; `ui`/`api`/a path narrows it).

1. **Capture the baseline BEFORE touching anything** — on clean, up-to-date `main`:
   - api: `dotnet build` (0 errors), `dotnet test` (record the pass count), and
     `dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes` (record: no pending model changes).
   - ui: per-workspace type-check / lint / test pass counts. Note known local-only noise
     (`@sentry/*`, `@playwright/test` absent locally fail there but pass in CI — confirm
     they don't reproduce on clean `main` before blaming a change).
2. **Build the ranked inventory (verification-protocol §1).** Fan out **read-only
   `Explore` scouts, 3 concurrent**, to inventory the worst offenders per repo (target the
   top ~20): largest files, deepest nesting, thinnest abstractions, most-duplicated logic,
   most layer-leakage — ranked by blast-radius × churn. This list is **binding**: by the
   end every entry is either **fixed** or in the **Deferred ledger** with a concrete,
   verified reason. There is no "quietly skipped" bucket — that is the failure this skill
   exists to prevent.

Read `.claude/skills/_shared/verification-protocol.md` — its coverage contract (§1) and
Deferred ledger (§4) govern this run.

---

## Phase 1 — Parallel behavior-preserving refactors

Fan out subagents, **3 concurrent**, each owning non-overlapping inventory items, each in
its **own git worktree** (`isolation: worktree`) so parallel edits never collide. Each
subagent:

- Applies only the behavior-preserving techniques above (C# `partial class` + `static`
  helper classes; TS sibling extraction with identical render tree / hook order / public
  props). No new services, no reflection, no new commands/endpoints.
- **Honors cross-platform parity (MANDATORY).** A split in `apps/web` lands the mirror
  split in `apps/mobile` and vice-versa. **Never claim web↔mobile symmetry without opening
  both files** — a file that looks like a monolith on one platform is often already split
  on the other; verify, don't assume.
- **Reports size honestly.** If a giant file becomes many files that still carry the same
  tangled logic, say "relocated, not simplified" in the Applied table — do not dress
  relocation up as a code-judo win.

Subagents do the edits only; **the orchestrator owns all git/build/test** (a shared tree +
parallel `dotnet`/`turbo` runs corrupt each other). Collect each subagent's diff summary.

---

## Phase 2 — Hard verification gates (behavior preservation IS the gate)

Nothing merges until every gate is green. Run from the orchestrator, per touched repo:

- **api**: `dotnet build` (0 errors) → `dotnet test` (**0 failures, count ≥ baseline**) →
  `dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes` (**model byte-identical — no pending
  changes**; a pending change means the refactor altered the schema → revert it).
- **ui**: per-workspace **type-check + lint + test**, each green and count ≥ baseline.
- **Comment gate (orbit-api):** `ORBIT0001` (no-narration-comments) is **silent in local
  `dotnet build`** (analyzer Roslyn-version mismatch) but **enforced in CI** — grep changed
  C# for bare `//` lines that are not `///` and carry no `http(s)://` URL before pushing,
  or CI fails on a locally-green build.
- **Sonar note:** a large relocation refactor will trip SonarCloud's "Coverage on New Code
  ≥80%" gate (relocated under-tested lines re-count as "new"). This is an attribution
  artifact, not a regression — resolve by **admin-overriding that gate**, never by writing
  ~100 view-component tests against the "test behavior not implementation" rule. Surface it
  to the user as a decision; don't silently scope-creep into mass test-writing.

A finding that survives all gates ships. Anything that can't be made green is **reverted**
and moved to the Deferred ledger — a refactor is not worth a behavior risk.

---

## Phase 3 — Deliver (one PR per repo)

A fresh branch off latest `main` per touched repo (`chore/nuclear-review` for orbit-api,
`chore/nuclear-review-ui` for orbit-ui-mobile — never reuse a squash-merged branch). One
PR per repo, cross-linked, with:

```markdown
## Thermo-Nuclear Structural Review — {repo}

**Behavior-preserving** structural refactor. No behavior / UI / contract / schema change.

### Applied
| File(s) | Before → after | Technique | Honest note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ProcessUserChatCommand.cs | 1227 → 275 (+6 partials) | partial class | decomposed by responsibility |
| habit-list.tsx | 1888 → 1604 | sibling extraction | PARTIAL — residual is closure-bound render |

### Deferred (verification-protocol §4)
| Inventory item | Why not done | 
|---|---|
| db-context.cs | single cohesive config; splitting adds indirection for no leverage |
| ... every un-fixed inventory entry, with a concrete reason | |

### Verification
- api: build ✅ · tests {N}/{N} (baseline {B}) ✅ · EF model identical ✅
- ui: type-check ✅ · lint ✅ · tests ✅
- Sonar new-code-coverage gate: expected relocation artifact → override (see note)
```

**Do not merge** — hand the PRs to the user. Branch protection + squash-merge are theirs
to click.

---

## Guardrails — do NOT

- **Change behavior, UI, an API/DTO contract, or the EF model.** If you can't prove a
  change is invisible to callers and to the database, it is out of scope — revert + defer.
- **Fix two easy files and stop.** The Phase-0 inventory is binding; every entry is fixed
  or in the Deferred ledger.
- **Silently omit a big offender.** A hard file left alone is a Deferred-ledger line with a
  reason, never an unstated gap.
- **Claim parity without opening both files.** Verify web↔mobile symmetry by reading each.
- **Report relocation as simplification.** Honest Applied notes only.
- **Let a subagent run git/build/test** on the shared tree — the orchestrator owns those.
- **Add a new abstraction for its own sake.** Deepen existing modules; the simplicity and
  no-premature-abstraction rules still hold (this cuts code, never adds speculative layers).
